## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

This was my first attempt at building a project web app so everything was new me. I faced many challeneges along the way.
I didn't fully comprehend the Get/Request/Post mapping methods use in order to retrieve and store info on the site. I spent many hours watching videos on youtube in order understand these concept. However, everyone has a different of implementing, so it became confusing. I probably took in more info than I needed at this point and it left me frazzled. However, I did accomplish my goal to develope a project. This isn't project I wanted to do, but it was the project I needed to do. My next step will be developing a ecommerce web application in the future.






## Future Improvements

- I hope to add the ability to upload profile pics to the app.
- I had tried several different ways including "enctype=multipart/form", however the results were the same. Either null or the pics weren't rendering on the site
- I also want the user to have the ability the update their own profile and password/email
